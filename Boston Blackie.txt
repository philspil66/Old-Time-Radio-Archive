Ever wonder what Boston Blackie's real name was? For your information it is
HORATIO BLACK.

Writer Jack Boyle's Boston Blackie has been around for some 85 years. There
were books, movies (silent and sound), radio shows and TV programs. Blackie
led a colorful life - from bad to good.  He started out as a thief, burglar and
all-around bad guy. He was jailed and before turning straight he had a terrible
prison experience. He decided that enough was enough and became the Blackie we
all know and love - a pillar of society, a sort of person who solved crimes
wuth the able assistance of his companion, Mary Wesley. Sort of like the
Shadow's Lamont Cranston and Margo, Nick and Nora Charles and Mr. and Mrs.
North. There was a serious side of Blackie and a whimsical one also. There was
the inept police Inspector Farraday who always needed help.

There were two parts of the radio-based Boston Blackie. First there was Chester
Morris' version. This was a 13 week cycle that replaced The Amos'n'Andy Show
during the summer of 1944. After this and for the remainder of the program,
Dick Kollmar took over the role. Mr. Kollmar portrayed Blackie from Apr 11, 1945
until Oct 25, 1950. There were a total of 233 episodes of the series spread out
over the years 1944 to 1950. There were 302 broadcast dates including original
shows plus repeats.

There are at this time 198 or so shows in circulation. This "log" was created to
assist in the indentification of each program. Since they were not titled as
they reached the collectors, different designations were assigned. Listed
below are probably all the existing Boston Blackie shows with all titles.
There are three sections to this log: 1) Chronological list with the show
number, date, titles, story synopsis and first lines. 2) An alphabetical list
of ALL titles along with their show number and dates for easy indentification.
3) The first line(s) of each show plus the show number and air date for cross-
reference.
