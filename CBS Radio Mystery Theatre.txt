Number of original shows 1399; total broadcasts counting repeats: 2969

The CBS Radio Mystery indeed heralded the revival of the Golden Age of Radio.
With the fine actor E. G. Marshall as the host, the series brought
back those great days of mystery, suspense, drama and a touch of history. At
first it aired daily, a monumental task when you consider this. But after some
six years it went to five times a week. Mr. Marshall hosted the series
until its final year when Tammy Grimes took over the chore on Feb 1, 1982.
For the most part long-time radio personalities were heard with a smattering
of TV and movie actors doing their part. Almost all of the story lines were
newly written and produced, but there were some adaptions based on novels by
Edgar Allan Poe, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, O.
Henry, Nathaniel Hawthorne to name a few. The end of the series came quite
quickly in early December 1982 with re-runs filling in the balance of the
year.

This log is divided into two sections. The first lists each program as well
as repeats in chronological order. The second part is an alphabetical listing
of all the programs.
