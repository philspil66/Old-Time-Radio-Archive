Series Description:

CHANDU THE MAGICIAN first aired from 1932 to 1936 as a daily 15-
minute serial.  The series starred Gayne Whitman.  Approximately
eighty episodes exist from this run.  Most of the episodes that
survived are from the end of the '32-'36 series.

The scripts from the first run were reproduced in the 1948 to 1949
version, starring Tom Collins in the title role.  The complete run
of 154 episodes is available from this series.  The series is broken
into three stories.  The first is "The Search For Robert Regent" and
has 68 15-minute episodes (or chapters).  The second is "Mission To
Montabania", with 48 15-minute episodes.  The third, and last, is
"The Return Of Roxor", consisting of 38 15-minute shows.

The last 15-minute show was on January, 28, 1949.  On February 3,
1949, the show switched to a once-a-week, 30-minute format.  It
started with a 13 show series, of which 12 are available.  This
series was a condensed version of "The Search For Robert Regent".

There were about 30 shows following the 13 week run on Mutual.
This new series was on ABC, and the emphasis is on Frank Chandler
the spy, with maybe one magic stunt at the end to wrap up the plot.
The women of the family are pretty much missing, as is Princess
Nadji.  Bob pops up occasionally.  These shows sound very rushed,
and some are rehashes of old stories.  All in all, they are pretty
poor - this from a Chandu fan.  (Last paragraph was based on info
from Max Schmid. See Feedback.)


Log Comments:

Since the full run of the earlier run is not available, This list is
restricted to the 1948 / 1949 15-minute serials, the 30-minute shows
that followed and some of the shows from the final ABC series.

A number of catalogs show episode numbers that follow the full run.
For example, one catalog offers episodes 1 through 154 of the 1948-
1949 run.  Since I could break that run into 3 parts, I've numbered
episodes based on episodes in each part.

Many catalogs listed only episode numbers and no titles.  Titles in
this log were the first ones found.  For example, titles for episode
21 through 68 of the 1948 "The Search For Robert Regent" came from
the Radio Memories catalog.  No attempt to list alternate titles has
been made.
